Version: 0.0.4
Date: 06.23.2025
  Added:
    - added `changelog.txt` for documenting major changes
    - added `scripts/build_package.py` to easily build release packages
  Fixes:
    - ingredients is now full "array" with `type`, `name` and `amount`
    - same with `results`
    - `emissions_per_minute` needs to be an array, `pollution` now contains it
    - there is no `hr_version` anymore, all graphics are now HR
